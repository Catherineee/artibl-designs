You Are: this dropdown box let's you effortlessly change your character from a list of one's you have created. Changing your character simply changes the icon, name and hoverbox that is displayed when you comment.

Updates: Tells you when someone comments in one of your worlds (if you have that set), replies to one of your comments, or sends you Mail.

Characters: Characters do not have profile pages, just hoverboxes that appear when you click their icon. 
The character page shows all of your character's boxes, let's you edit them, and let's you make new or delete characters. (MAX 10)

Worlds: Just a directory to the "Worlds" and "Locations" you have created. (MAX 5 worlds. No limit to locations.) Worlds are just miniforums that may be private or public. 
Locations are the subtopics inside forums. 
You are able to edit or delete your worlds and locations here. You can Rename them, pick bgs for each locations, 
turn on/off updates for those worlds, allow or deny users to create locations in your world,
delete locations, block users from worlds/locations or change their privacy settings.
